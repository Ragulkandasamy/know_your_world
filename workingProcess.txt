In this process, the system uniquely identifies the features in the image given like color code, characters and some unique parameters in the source object. 
The above parameters are the only way to scan the unique factors object. Frame markers play a major role in the identification of an image or a video that is already 
embedded in the application.

TARGET RECOGNITION AND VIDEO PLAYBACK:
Once the frame markers identify the target or the image that needs to be processed it connects to the Vuforia database and 
verifies the image shown with the target image and executes the functions. If the image is shown and the target images match the respected function
allocated will be executed. In this application, the video explaining the particular image or symbol will play accordingly.
